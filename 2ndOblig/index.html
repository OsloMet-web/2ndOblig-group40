    <h3>Diverse Seal Species</h3>
    <p>Seals come in various species, each with its own distinct 
        characteristics. True seals, eared seals (sea lions), 
        and the walrus make up this family. From the harbor 
        seal's cuteness to the power of the elephant seal, 
        they all have their place in the marine world.</p>
    <h3>Adaptations for Aquatic Life</h3>
    <p>Seals are perfectly suited for life in the water. 
        Their streamlined bodies reduce water resistance, 
        and their blubber layer provides insulation against cold waters. 
        Powerful flippers help them glide through the ocean, while their 
        ability to hold their breath for extended periods aids in hunting.
         Their keen underwater vision is a crucial asset for finding prey
          in the depths.</p>
    <h3>Ecological Significance</h3>
    <p>Seals hold a key position in the marine food chain. 
        They feed on fish, squid, and crustaceans, helping 
        to regulate their populations. Additionally, seals 
        serve as prey for larger predators like sharks and orcas. 
        Their excrement, rich in nutrients, fertilizes marine ecosystems, 
        promoting the growth of vital organisms like phytoplankton, which 
        absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and help regulate the 
        Earth's climate.</p>
